# Agent Registry

Use this file to track who is working, where they are working, and whether the controller has capacity to spawn more agents.

## Capacity

- Max active planners: 1
- Max active runners: 1
- Max active reviewers: 1
- Max active integrators: 1
- Max total active agents: 1
- Capacity note: paced autonomous default. Raise capacity only for a named pass when the user explicitly wants a supervised burst.

## Controller Lease

| Owner | Started | Expected Action | Stop Condition | Stale After | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | none | none | none | 90 minutes | No active lease after bootstrap turn completes. |

## Active Agents

| Agent / Thread | Task ID | Role | Status | Branch | Worktree | PR | Started | Last Seen | Expected Next Step | Heartbeat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | none | none | none | none | none | none | none | none | none | none |

## Paused / Stale Agents

## Reservations / Locks

| Path / Area | Task ID | Owner | Branch / Worktree | Reason | Release Condition |

## Rules

- The controller updates this registry before spawning a subagent and after receiving its result.
- Active Agents should include only agents still expected to report.
- Do not spawn a new agent when it would exceed capacity.
- Do not spawn two agents with overlapping write scopes unless one is read-only.
- Workers normally update only their own handoff and report back; the controller consolidates this registry.
- During parallel work, the controller owns `docs/swarm/task-board.md`, `docs/swarm/current-state.md`, `docs/swarm/controller-directives.md`, and this registry unless a handoff explicitly assigns one of those files.
